## Secure Access System

A Java-based simulation of a secure login system with
failed-attempt monitoring and intrusion alerts.

### Features
- Authentication logic
- Failed login tracking
- Intrusion detection alert
- Clean and structured Java code

### Purpose
Built as a practice project to strengthen core Java,
problem-solving, and system-style logic.

[Note:
Some small corrections and improvements in this project were assisted by AI, 
but I’ve also been learning a lot on my own through YouTube tutorials and practice.
This project reflects what I’ve learned so far and my own coding efforts.]
